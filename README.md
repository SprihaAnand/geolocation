# Geolocation

Our project aims to connect book donors with nearby NGOs through the utilization of Google APIs and geolocation technology. By leveraging the power of Google's services, we provide a user-friendly interface that enables individuals to easily locate and donate their books to NGOs in their vicinity.

When users access our platform, they are presented with a "Find Your Nearest NGO" button. Upon clicking this button, the Google Maps integration instantly displays the closest NGOs based on the user's current location. This feature streamlines the process of finding a suitable organization to donate books to, ensuring that the donation process is convenient and efficient.

In addition to facilitating book donations, our platform includes a "Why Donate?" section. Here, users can explore the various reasons why donating books is beneficial. We emphasize the importance of sharing knowledge and fostering a culture of reading and sharing. By donating books, users can help give new life to old books and contribute to reducing carbon footprints by encouraging book reuse rather than discarding them.

Furthermore, our platform highlights how donations can make a significant impact. We emphasize that sharing books can create a ripple effect, as the knowledge and emotions attached to the donated books can inspire and empower others. By donating, users become a part of a greater cause for change, making a difference in the world by promoting literacy and education.

With our project's integration of Google APIs, we provide a seamless experience for book donors to locate and contribute to NGOs, encouraging them to take part in the noble act of sharing knowledge and fostering literacy. By connecting individuals with NGOs, we hope to create a positive impact and spread the joy of reading.

## API Reference
####  Geolocation API overview

The Geolocation API is a service that accepts an HTTPS request with the cell tower and WiFi access points that a mobile client can detect. It returns latitude/longitude coordinates and a radius indicating the accuracy of the result for each valid input.

#### Resources

| Data resources	 | Data returned     | Return format                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
